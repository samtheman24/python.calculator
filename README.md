# Customised Python Calculator
## fit for purpose

### design breif:
this design is made for people that are on the older side.
* #### colour
  * the colours that have been used are used because they make the cakcukator look bright.
  * the **website** i used for these colours is [**colourpicker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
there are the signs on the side that have the sign and in brackets what it is
(e.g: / (divide))

the buttons are also bigger just incase some people might accidentely mis click and hit the wrong botton. it just makes more easier to not 
hit the wrong botton
